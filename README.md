## NextJS STARTER PACK


## Installation

On the command-line or Terminal, navigate to the root of the directory which you downloaded and run:

* If you have npm: `npm install`
* If you have yarn: `yarn install`

## Run app

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Running JEST tests

Here are a few commands you should now be able to run JEST tests:

* Run Jest tests once: `npm test` or `yarn test`
* Run Jest in watch mode (great for TDD): `npm run test:watch` or `yarn test:watch`

## Running CYPRESS tests

Here are a few commands you should now be able to run Cypress tests:

* Open Cypress creator: `npm cypress:open` or `yarn cypress:open`
* Open Cypress e2e tests: `npm e2e` or `yarn e2e`
* Run Cypress e2e headless tests (with video): `npm e2e:headless` or `yarn e2e:headless`
* Open Cypress component tests: `npm component` or `yarn component`
* Run Cypress headless component tests (with video): `npm component:headless` or `yarn component:headless`
